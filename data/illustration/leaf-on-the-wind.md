  This _Serenity_ inspired design was created with screen printing in mind. The image was created by layering 6 colors (not counting the background).  The colors are layered using halftones (small, solid dots that give the impression of transparency -- and the effect all over this site) at different angles, which gives the impression of many more specific colors being present.
