This is a project that got scrapped by the client prior to completion.  The objective was to allow users to take photos, combine them into a collage, and allow the user to upload them for a contest.  Built with native javascript and the HTML5 canvas API, the user can select a template then fill it in with photos.  The photos can then be scaled (middle mouse scroll on desktop, pinch/zoom on touch devices) and positioned (drag) to create a unique final image.  The templates are loaded from JSON, making it easy to add them.

The project got canceled before I got to feature complete, so there’s no ability to save your image.  Also, buggy behavior may appear on certain devices since full testing was never done.  But I still think it’s neat.
