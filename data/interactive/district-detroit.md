excerpt: Building excitement for building up a city.
---

This is the first full size site I built as part of Lowe Campbell-Ewald.  To be clear, my role was specifically development and mobile adaptation of the design.

The site is built on Craft.  This CMS gave me the most flexibility, and I was able to manipulate it so that it’s easy to add reusable blocks, making maintenance over the planned multi-year enhancement cycle as easy as possible.

Thanks to Grunt, I’m also able to deliver the most efficient files possible.  Everything is delivered minified, but completely maintainable.  Its original source files are broken down and divided so that it’s easy to find any styles or scripts in our development environments.
