  Finding the fastest route between two grid squares is surprisingly complicated.

HTML5's canvas element opened up a lot of possibilities.  Early in its lifespan, it's usefulness in game creation was already obvious.  While working at ePrize (now HelloWorld), this was something that I saw as obviously useful.  This is something I wrote to help explore the possibilities of the new technology.  While it never progressed beyond this proof of concept, I still think it's pretty cool.

Note that the barriers are generated randomly, so itâ€™s possible for the map to spawn with the player (die) trapped in the corner.  If that occurs, just refresh the page and it will re-generate everything.
