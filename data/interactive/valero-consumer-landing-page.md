<p class="lead-in">A single page experience to connect digital marketing to real locations.</p>

This simple page was built as a destination for social media, banners, and other forms of digital marketing. But from there, it was adapted into something of its own value. It offered a tool to find Valero locations, information about the credit cards and gift cards, and some nice touches to emphasize the brand's feel.

## Integrated Interactivity

Valero's internal team had already created a map tool to show locations. We were able to iframe that tool into our page, offering the most valuable experience possible to users.

## Users in Motion

The entire masthead area was created to resemble the end card of TV spots running at the same time. Since our work is in an interactive space, we decided to tie the user's actions into the feeling of motion that the spot conveyed through video. We did this by animating a few layers of images to scale and move along with the user's scrolling.

This gives the effect of cresting the hill. "Driving" under the Valero logo and tagline to get to where the user is going reinforces the connection between Valero and car travel.

Although ultimately a simple project, the page offered a nice, consumer friendly face to a brand that previously focused on B2B.

Unfortunately, the page is no longer live.
